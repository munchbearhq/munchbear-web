# munchbear-web

Web app for MunchBear built with SvelteKit.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
bun x sv@0.15.3 create --template minimal --types ts --add prettier eslint tailwindcss="plugins:typography,forms" sveltekit-adapter="adapter:auto" --install bun my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```sh
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

### Supply Chain Security

This project is configured with a 24-hour delay for new package versions in `bunfig.toml` to mitigate supply chain attacks. Any package published within the last 24 hours will not be installed or updated.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
